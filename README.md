# Numboard_X : The Number Pad Soundboard

![Blank Numboard](http://i.imgur.com/c6HvES4.png)

This soundboard is designed for *maximum simplicity*. The GUI maps directly to the numpad. Audio files are be assigned to the buttons via drag-and-drop. 

To simplify the common usage of virtual audio cables there are two selectable output devices, 
one can route to your speakers/headphones, and the other can route to a the output of an audio repeater. 
Other software (such as "EXP Soundboard") requires *two* audio repeaters in order to function properly. 

# Features
- Drag & Drop
  - drag audio files onto buttons for easy setup
  - quickly swap between files when you need them most
- Quick Swap Save Files
  - Instant access to all your save files from the sidear
  - Swap between save files for 'presets' of sound files
- Global Hotkeys
  - Pressing any numpad key will trigger it's corresponding sound
  - The numpad hotkeys are *global*, meaning that you can use this software while in-game or otherwise out of the softwares typical context
  - Stop all playing sounds at once via the "Stop All" key, bound to the decimal key. 
  - Stop the sounds playing from a specific button by holidng the "Stop Single" key and pressing the offending button, bound to the '0' key. 
- Extensive Volume Control
  - Master volume
  - Primary output volume
  - Secondary volume
  - Per-Button Volume

# Requirements
- Windows OS
- A Keyboard with a number pad
- Num-Lock is `on`
- Virtual Audio Cables (only necessary if trying to get a the soundboard to play through a game or skype / discord properly)

# Gaming Setup
- Virtual Audio Cables setup with at least 1 line out (`Line 1`)
- An audio repeater from <your microphone> to `Line 1 In`
- Assign 'Primary Output Device' to your speakers/headphones
- Assign 'Secondary Output Device' to `Line 1 Out`

I reccomend just watching one of the tutorials on youtube in order to get Virtual Audio Cables up and running with the reccomended configuration.
